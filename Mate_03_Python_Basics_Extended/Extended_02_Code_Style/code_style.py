"""
Python has a widely accepted style guide called PEP 8 (Python Enhancement Proposal 8)
which provides conventions on how to format Python code for maximum readability.
Adhering to a consistent coding style makes your code more maintainable and helps collaboration
with other developers.

Here are some key points from PEP 8:

1. Indentation
2. Maximum Line Length
3. Imports
4. Whitespace in Expressions and Statements
5. Comments
6. Naming Conventions
7. Function and Method Arguments


1. Indentation:
Use 4 spaces per indentation level. Never use tabs.

2. Maximum Line Length:
Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters for code (72 for docstrings and comments).

3. Imports:
Imports should usually be on separate lines. Wildcard imports (from module import *)
should be avoided.

4. Whitespace in Expressions and Statements
Avoid extraneous whitespace spaces inside brackets and before/after comparison operators.

5. Comments:
Comments should be complete sentences and placed on a line of their own if possible.

6. Naming Conventions:
Follow the naming conventions outlined in PEP 8.
In general, use lowercase for variable and function names, and use underscores to separate words.

7. Function and Method Arguments:
Don't put spaces around the = sign when used to indicate a keyword argument or
a default parameter value.

Adhering to PEP 8 helps maintain a clean and consistent code base.
You can use integrate linters in your development environment to automatically format your code
according to PEP 8.
