"""
Debugging is the process of identifying and fixing errors, or bugs, in your code.

PyCharm:
1. Setting Breakpoints:
Place breakpoints by clicking in the left margin of the code editor next to the line number
where you want to pause execution.

2. Debug Configuration:
Ensure your PyCharm Run/Debug Configuration is set to run in debug mode.
This is usually a green bug icon next to the Run button.

3. Run in Debug Mode:
Click the Run button or press Shift + F9 to run your code in debug mode.
Execution will pause at the breakpoints you set.

4. Debugger Panel:
The Debugger panel at the bottom of the PyCharm window provides tools to inspect variables,
control execution, and navigate through the code.

5. Stepping Through Code:
Use the "Step Over" (F8), "Step Into" (F7), and "Step Out" (Shift + F8)
buttons to navigate through your code one step at a time.

6. Variable Inspection:
Hover over variables in the code editor to see their current values, or use the Variables tab
in the Debugger panel.

7. Watches:
Add watches to keep an eye on specific variables. Right-click on a variable and select
"Add to Watches".

8. Evaluate Expression:
Use the "Evaluate Expression" feature to check the value of an expression during debugging.

9. Console:
You can interact with your code in the Python Console at the bottom of the PyCharm window
while debugging.
