"""
Working with numbers in Python involves performing various mathematical operations,
using built-in functions, and leveraging the capabilities of numeric data types.
Here's a brief overview:

1. Basic Arithmetic Operations:
Python supports standard arithmetic operations for numbers:

# Addition +
# Subtraction  -
# Multiplication *
# Division /
# Exponentiation **

2. Numeric Data Types:
Python has several numeric data types. Being the most common:

# int (integer)
# float (floating-point)

3. Type Conversion:
You can convert between different numeric types using functions like int(), float(), and str().

4. Math Module (import math):

# Square root -> sqrt_result = math.sqrt(25)
# Trigonometric -> sin_result = math.sin(math.radians(30)), cos_result = math.cos(math.radians(60))
# Constants -> pi_value = math.pi

5. Random Module:
The random module is useful for generating random numbers (import random):

# Generate a random integer between 1 and 10 -> random_integer = random.randint(1, 10)
# Generate a random float between 0 and 1 -> random_float = random.random()

6. Formatting Numbers:
You can format numbers for display using the format() function or f-strings.

# formatted_number = format(1234567, ",") Output: '1,234,567'

7. Advanced Operations:
Python supports more advanced operations, such as complex numbers, bitwise operations,
and modular arithmetic.

# Complex numbers -> complex_result = complex(1, 2) * complex(2, 3)
# Bitwise operations -> bitwise_and = 5 & 3, bitwise_or = 5 | 3
# Modulo -> modulo_result = 17 % 5
