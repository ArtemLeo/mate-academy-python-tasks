Working with strings in Python involves various operations, such as:
string creation, manipulation, formatting, and searching.

1. Creating Strings:
Strings in Python can be created using single quotes ('), double quotes ("),
or triple quotes (''')

# single_quoted = 'Hello, World!'
# double_quoted = "Python is fun!"
# triple_quoted = '''This is a multiline string.'''

2. String Concatenation:
You can concatenate strings using the + operator.

# first_name = "John"
# last_name = "Doe"
# full_name = first_name + " " + last_name

3. String Multiplication:
You can use the * operator to repeat a string.

# greeting = "Hello, " * 3

4. String Indexing and Slicing:
Access individual characters in a string using indexing, and extract substrings using slicing.

# text = "Python"
# first_char = text[0]  -> 'P'
# substring = text[1:4]  -> 'yth'

5.String Methods:
Python provides a variety of built-in string methods for common operations:

# message = "   Hello, World!   "
# Remove leading and trailing whitespaces -> rimmed_message = message.strip()
# Convert to lowercase or uppercase -> lowercase_message = message.lower() or message.upper()
# Replace substring -> new_message = message.replace("World", "Python")
# Find substring -> index = message.find("Hello")

6. String Formatting:
You can format strings using f-strings method (formatted string literals).

# name = "Alice", age = 30
# formatted_string = f"Name: {name}, Age: {age}"

7. Escape Characters:
Escape characters are used to represent special characters in a string.

# escaped_string = "This is a \"quote\" and a new line.\nSecond line."

8. String Length:
Use the len() function to get the length of a string.

# length = len("Hello, World!")

9. Checking Substrings:
Use the in operator to check if a substring is present in a string.

# contains_python = "Python" in "Hello, Python!"


These are just some of the basic string operations in Python.
Understanding these concepts will help you effectively work with strings and manipulate text data
in your Python programs.
